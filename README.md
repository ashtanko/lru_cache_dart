## LruCache Dart Package

`lru_cache` is a Dart package that provides a simple and efficient implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. This package uses Dart's built-in `LinkedHashMap` to maintain the order of elements based on their access history, making it suitable for scenarios where you want to limit the number of cached items and evict the least recently used items when the cache reaches its maximum capacity.

### Features

- **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache**: Keeps track of the most recently accessed items and evicts the least recently used items when the cache reaches its maximum size.

- **Customizable Size Calculation**: Allows customization of how the size of cached items is calculated through a `sizeOf` method, which can be overridden to fit specific use cases.

- **Thread-safe Operations**: Uses synchronized methods to ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying the cache, making it safe for concurrent use.

## Getting started ðŸŽ‰

To use `lru_cache` in your Dart project, add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```dart
dependencies:
  lru_cache: ^latest_version
```

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the LruCache class:

```dart
import 'package:lru_cache/lru_cache.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an LruCache with a maximum size of 2
  final cache = LruCache<String, String>(2);

  // Put key-value pairs into the cache
  cache.put('key1', 'value1');
  cache.put('key2', 'value2');

  // Retrieve values from the cache
  print(cache.get('key1')); // Prints 'value1'
  print(cache.get('key2')); // Prints 'value2'

  // Add another key-value pair, evicting the least recently used item
  cache.put('key3', 'value3');
  print(cache.get('key1')); // Prints 'null' because 'key1' was evicted

  // Retrieve the remaining items from the cache
  print(cache.get('key2')); // Prints 'value2'
  print(cache.get('key3')); // Prints 'value3'

  // Display cache statistics
  print(cache.toString()); // Prints 'LruCache[maxSize=2,hits=2,misses=1,hitRate=66%]'
}
```
